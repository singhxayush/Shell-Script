In the forest deep and green,
A wondrous sight can be seen.
Trees tall and mighty stand,
Stretching up to touch the land.

Leaves rustle in the gentle breeze,
A symphony of swaying trees.
The forest floor is soft and lush,
A carpet of leaves in shades of blush.

Birds sing a melody sweet,
Their voices a rhythm to the beat.
Squirrels chatter and scurry about,
As if they're playing a game of hide and seek, no doubt.

The forest is a place of peace,
Where nature's beauty never cease.
It's a haven for creatures big and small,
Where they live and thrive in this wonderland sprawl.

So let us all protect this forest fair,
And keep it safe for generations to share.
Let us cherish its beauty and keep it clean,
So that its wonders may always be seen.
